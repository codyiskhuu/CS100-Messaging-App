# Duette
Duette is an android based application that supports messaging to two or more users. A messaging application that uses a Google Firebase that holds all the information and stores it. We parse information back and forth from each user and the cloud to update each person in the chat. 
Additionally each account is accessed through google emails storing information in the database to allow everyone to have a unique account that supports both messaging to an unlimited amount of people.
